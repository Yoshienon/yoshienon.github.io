**Project Goal & Purpose**

This Matching Card Game website was developed as part of an activity in my subject, **Application Development and Emerging Technologies**. 
Online games are among the most popular types of software enjoyed by many internet users. 
I aimed to create a game that is easy to build, accessible, and entertaining, regardless of age or technological experience.

To achieve this, I chose to design a princess-themed matching card game.

The game features simple mechanics: flip cards, find matching pairs, and complete the game before the timer runs out. 
It includes an engaging visual design, a countdown timer, flip counter, sound effects, and a light fairy tale storyline to enhance the user experience.
